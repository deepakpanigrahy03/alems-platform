PERFORMANCE COUNTERS DATA MODEL
================================================================================

This module defines the PerformanceCounters data class used throughout Module 1
to store hardware performance counter readings.

The class provides:
- Type-safe fields for all counter types
- Derived metrics (IPC, cache miss rate)
- Serialization methods
